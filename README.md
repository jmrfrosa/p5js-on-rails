# README

Small application running a P5.js script inside. This is intended to serve as a reference in how to get P5.js up and running in a Rails server.

Rails version: 5.0.0.1

Just `rails s` and edit your canvas code inside `app/views/pages/_p1_canvas.html.erb`.

# In Development

Currently adding a p5 sketch directory (already working under `/sketches`) to try and attempt to code a full CRUD app from scratch and without scaffolding. Will try and merge this with the main page.
